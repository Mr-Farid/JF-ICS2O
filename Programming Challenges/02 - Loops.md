Programming in Processing Challenges
-------

The following will give you practice with _for loops_

1. Create a program that draws 100 circles of random colours to the screen.  The fill values should not change over time.
2. Create a program that draws 100 lines originating from the center of the screen of random lengths, and of random colours.  The fill values should not change over time.
3. Create a program that draws 100 triangles, where each new triangle is connected to the previous triangle on 1 point.  All triangles should have a random fill colour that does not change over time.
4. Create a program that fills the screen with randomly sized rectangles that **do not** overlap, but fill the screen. The maximum size of a rectangle is 1/15th of the screen size.
5. Create a program that fills the screen with randomly sized circles that **do not** overlap, but fill the entire screen.  The maximum size of a single circle is 1/15th of the screen size.
6. Create a program that draws between 80 and 120 points (randomly chosen) to the screen. Have the program connect the dots using lines; however, you can only generate non-overlapping triangles.
